                <p>Technical skills are the abilities, knowledge, or expertise required to perform specific, job-related tasks. Technical skills are related to jobs in science, engineering, tech, manufacturing, or finance. They are learned through on-the-job experience or structured learning.But then again, every job requires a different skill set. For some, it will be optimizing neural networks, for others sketching wireframes. For most of us it might be something like using spreadsheets to track sales.</p>
